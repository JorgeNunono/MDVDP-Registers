    Register 0 "Mode Set Register #1":

        Bit 0: !!! Should be set to 0 normally - Enables locking onto external sync via the CSync pin, no display without a valid sync pulse source;
        Bit 1: M3 HV counter latch enable;
        Bit 2: !!! Should be set to 1 normally - M4 - Enables full palette bit depth as opposed to just the LSBs;
        Bit 3: !!! Should be set to 0 normally - Outputs VCounter(0) on HSync pin when set, messes up EDCLK divisor ratios, RS0/1 = 11 H40 video mode will get thrashed, H32/H40 modes using the internal dot clock generator stay unaffected;
        Bit 4: IE1 (Horizontal interrupt enable) - Will trigger an interrupt immediately when set because they occur in the background anyway;
        Bit 5: LCB (Leftmost column blank), only covers the leftmost 8-pixel column - leftover from SMS;
        Bit 6: Unused or unknown effect, Former SMS horizontal scroll lock;
        Bit 7: Forces columns 24-31 (but not 32-39 in H40 mode) to a vertical scroll of 0 - Former SMS vertical scroll lock;


    Register 1 "Mode Set Register #2":

        Bit 0: Unused or unknown effect - Charles mentions that setting this bit causes the scroll values to shift the sync pulse positions, former SMS Sprite MAG;
        Bit 1: Unused or unknown effect - Former SMS Sprite Size selection;
        Bit 2: M5 SMS / Genesis display select - Set for mnegadrive mode;
        Bit 3: M2 (Enable V30 - PAL Only) - setting this bit in NTSC mode causes loss of Vertical sync and level 4 interrupts trigger once per 2 frames;
        Bit 4: M1 (DMA Enable);
        Bit 5: IE0 (Vertical Interrupt Enable) - Similar to IE1, it will trigger an interrupt immediately when set because they occur in the background;
        Bit 6: DISP (Display Enable) - Only the BG color is drawn in normal intensity when this bit is cleared;
        Bit 7: !!! Should be set to 0 normally - Enables 128kB VRAM, corrupts display on a normal system due to address and data rearrengement (and the additional capacity is normally absent);

    Register C: "Mode Set Register #4":

        Bit 0: RS1 - Select Horizontal cell mode and internal dot clock divisor) - used to choose between H32/H40, when setting RS1 alone it makes the system produce a slightly faster (~16kHz) horizontal refresh rate;

        Bit 5: Disable HSync pin / Change HSync to input - messes up EDCLK (becomes constant 13.3 MHz), also used by the 32X; Maybe it could be used for video resyncronization although it's not clear how.

        Bit 7: RS0 - Selects External Dot Clock (EDCLK pin) - onlçy to be used for "normal" H40, setting RS0 alone (H32 mode) will result in a 19.5kHz horizontal refresh rate
