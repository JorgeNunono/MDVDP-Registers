        register   0: reading returns high-z (accessible by default without needing to write to C00018)
    
        Bit 0: Unused or unknown effect;
        Bit 1: Unknown: Appears to cause a infinite CRAM write cycle under certain circunstances. Unrecoverable, needs power cycle
        Bit 2: Unused or unknown effect;
        Bit 3: Unknown: Appears to cause a infinite CRAM write cycle under certain circunstances. Unrecoverable, needs power cycle
        Bit 4: Unused or unknown effect;
        Bit 5: Unknown: Appears to change VRAM interface when set (maybe non multiplexed SRAM-based?). Displays junk in a normal system because it only accesses up to 256 (scattered) locations
        Bit 6: Disables display and shows background color in normal or shadowed intensity, takes priority over register 1 - bit 6
        Bit 7: Forces layers to be always active (early systems will apply wire-OR to the color output and later systems wire-AND. Early systems will also corrupt the CRAM over time to a varying degree if the bits stay set)
        Bit 8: Forces layers to be always active (in combination with bit 7: 01 = sprites always visible, 10: plane A always visible, 11: plane B always visible)
        Bit 9: Replaces PSG overall output volume with channel volume when set
        Bit10: PSG channel select 
        Bit11: PSG channel select (11 = noise channel)
        Bit12: Unknown: Appears to freeze some sort of sprite internal process resulting in garbage
        Bit13: Unknown: Appears to freeze some sort of sprite internal process
        Bit14: Unknown: Appears to freeze some sort of sprite internal process
        Bit15: Unused or unknown effect;


        register 100: reading returns high-z

        Bit 0: Caution: Selects Z80 clock, 3.57 MHz when cleared or 7.6 MHz when set. Runs the CPU above its spec, may produce a runt pulse when changing the setting. The RAM is able to keep up with the higher speed but the CPU may not on a case by case basis. Speeds up PSG clock as well
        Bit 1: Hazard: EDCLK pin direction, conflicts with external on board driver when set (RS0/1 = 11 H40 video mode will get thrashed, may also harm the VDP or the divider IC pin in a normal system)
        Bit 2: Caution: Causes the VCounter to increment every pixel, destroys the sync pulse regardless of video mode
        Bit 3: Unused or unknown effect;
        Bit 4: (??) Moving junk pattern
        Bit 5: (??) Moving junk pattern
        Bit 6: (??) Moving junk pattern
